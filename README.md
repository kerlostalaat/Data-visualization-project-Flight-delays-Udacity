# Data-visualization-project-Flight-delays-Udacity
In this project, I try create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
